      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-i-went-from-a-small-town-kid-to-working-on-cutting-edge-ai-and-everything-that-happened-along-the-way&#34;&gt;How I Went from a Small Town Kid to Working on Cutting-Edge AI (And Everything That Happened Along the Way)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my story - I grew up in a small town in Rajasthan, raised by my kickass single mom and elder sister. School was my thing, and when I hit 11th grade, I fell hard for C++ programming. Like every other Indian kid with decent grades, I ended up at Allen Institute Kota for IIT-JEE prep. Spoiler alert: The pressure cooker environment there? Yeah, not my scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
