      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there fellow startup builder! I have been an early stage engineer with some product chops for around 8 years now having worked with a half dozen startups from bootstrapped/pre-seed funded to unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My base is in my hometown Udaipur, India and I have been exploring digital nomad lifestyle traveling around south east Asia from last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at a stage in my life / career where I want to double down on working towards things that I&amp;rsquo;m really passionate about and gives me a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
