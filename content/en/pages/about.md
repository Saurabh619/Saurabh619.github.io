Hey there fellow startup builder! I have been an early stage engineer with some product chops for around 8 years now having worked with a half dozen startups from bootstrapped/pre-seed funded to unicorns.

My base is in my hometown Udaipur, India and I have been exploring digital nomad lifestyle traveling around south east Asia from last couple of years.

I'm at a stage in my life / career where I want to double down on working towards things that I'm really passionate about and gives me a sense of purpose.
